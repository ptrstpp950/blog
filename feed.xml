If not, let‚Äôs dive in! I recently spent some time exploring ACA, and while it offers several benefits, there‚Äôs one crucial feature that‚Äôs conspicuously absent: the ability to use YAML configurations from Kubernetes (K8s). In this post, I‚Äôll discuss ACA, its advantages, and why the inclusion of YAML support would be a g... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Quo Vadis, Open-source?</title><link href="/quo-vadis-open-source/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quo Vadis, Open-source?" /><published>2024-04-09T08:30:12+00:00</published> <updated>2024-04-09T08:30:12+00:00</updated> <id>/quo-vadis-open-source/</id> <content src="/quo-vadis-open-source/" /> <author> <name>Piotr Stapp</name> </author> <summary> Reflecting on the past year, I‚Äôve become increasingly convinced that the open-source model faces challenges from various angles.

Especially when you forget their values, and you would like to retrieve them. In my case I didn‚Äôt store Azure service principal for test environment anywhere. Moreover I wanted to move them from project level into organization level. Unfortunately reading them from GitHub is not possible, but the actions have them.
