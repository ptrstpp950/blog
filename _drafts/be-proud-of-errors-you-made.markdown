title: Be proud of Errors you made
---

Today my son was almost cry because he made an error in tying his Judo belt on training. The trainer noticed that and said:
>Try better next time. 10 knee bend

If you ever train a sport "professionally" I'm sure that you recognize commands like : *10 knee bend* or *15 push ups* - there are only for your memory ;). They can be translated to *don't worry, next time will be better*

##"Ouch"
Neil Ohlenkamp, a Judo master, said:
>"Ouch" is not a Judo term.

But in IT we make errors almost every day. If not Me, probably my colleague on the left. Or the nice guy in the second room. Or maybe even You.

Be serious in IT we fail. Than we get up. Than we fail again. 
But every time we fail there should not be "ouch", but the new lesson learned.
