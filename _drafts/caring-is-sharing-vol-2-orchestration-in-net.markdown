Really interesting stuff this week. But before the main topic let's check out the bonus article.

[The 9 questions that uncover the most surprising insights from employees](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-9-questions-that-uncover-the-most-surprising-insights-from-employees-b7bc0d20ede8) - my first through a title is just a stupid click bait. Then I read the first question and I was surprised, also with the second and so one. It is worth to read, but be warn it can blow up your mind.

A bunch of links how to write code orchestrations in C# using the .Net Task framework and the async/await. Both are quite old because this is available from 2015. But wait for a second, Microsoft team commit to the GitHub repo almost every day. What is going on? They are adding Service Fabric implementation. The links are:
