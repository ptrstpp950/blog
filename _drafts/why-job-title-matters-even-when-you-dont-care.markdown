title: Why job title matters even when you don't care
---

I read a lot of blog posts about job title in IT. That I shouldn't care. That they aren't important in the recruitment process.
But in my opinion they are important as motivator. Or to be precise poor job title can demotivate.

##Do you know a "junior developer"?
I never meet a junior developer. Or to be precise I never meet a developer who was "junior" for more than month. Always *IT consulting magic* happened very fast:

##My first full time job
I don't remember my first month, but in the second one *consulting magic* happened. My task was to create SSIS package to join records from Access, Excel and SQL. And form this day my title was "experienced developer".
A few months later *senior* was added, because I was introduced in Ministry of Finance. Maybe it was even *specialist*. Two years later I become lead developer with team leader function. I every "key account manager" in my company have full range of titles to use.
During almost four years, I didn't care how they called me. I exactly knew who I was and what I was doing. My job title was only for consulting marketing stuff.
Anyway one day I decided to change my job. On [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrstapp) this job figures with only one title: senior developer.
