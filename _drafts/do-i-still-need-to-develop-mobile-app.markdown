title: Do I still need to develop mobile app
---

Mobile apps have dominated market. Even IT job boards are almost full of mobile developers job offers. But when I look on my phone I stopped to install new things (with one exception)
## Apps for everyone
There are a bunch of apps for everyone. Probably you have it on your phone. The list is short:

- social media apps
- banking
- notes/todo app
- some productivity tools
- music apps

Browser, email client, ... are bundled into OS, so people don't change them. Unless they found something more interesting. But to be serious, most of above list is installed in first week. 

## Games
This is my exception to above rule. I install new games frequently. Almost every week new game is downloaded to my phone. My explanation is simple: I have kids. 

## Museum
Imagine you are on holidays and you are visiting a museum in foreign country. To receive more information about exhibition, the museum suggests to install their app. I almost never do that, because:

- my roaming tariff is not cheap;
- there is now free WiFi there;
- I don't want to install app everywhere;
- I don't want to receive notifications in future and clean my phone after every visit.

A lot of my friends are doing the same. How about you? 

## Notifications & Augmented Reality
What if user have already installed app which support notifications, Bluetooth beacons and doesn't need internet access? Looks impossible, but it exists. First we can use local WiFi, without internet access, just local network. Every phone has WiFi built in, we can use it in browser to get data from local (intranet) server. The W3C is working on Web Bluetooth standard, which is supported by Chrome on Android, ChromeOS and MacOS. Unless it becomes a full standard Chrome supports it in trial mode. Notifications are supported
