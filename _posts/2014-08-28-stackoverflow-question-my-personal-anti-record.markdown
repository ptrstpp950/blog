Some minutes ago I asked a simple question on StackOverlow:

>[How to compile C# to .NET 4.0 on machine with 4.5.1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25555944/how-to-compile-c-sharp-to-net-4-0-on-machine-with-4-5-1?noredirect=1#comment39906700_25555944)

But in the text of question I made a stupid mistake because I wrote:
>In my computer I have .NET framework 4.0 How to be sure that compilation of c# project will run on machine with only .NET 4.5?

Of course You probably see **the problem**, a guy called [@tnw](http://stackoverflow.com/users/770270/tnw) write me a comment:
>Your question and title are totally different. What are you asking?

Until I updated my post it had already -8 points and 2 votes to close as not a real question. -8 point is ok ;), but why it is not a real question I don't know.

I updated my question to correct one, still forgetting that I didn't mention that I don't have a Visual Studio on compilation machine.
I updated my question to full details but I ended up with -14 points and marked as duplicate and it look like this (I make a screenshot because it has already 2 delete votes):

The funnest thing for me is that my best **answer** is for question:
> [Bootstrap 3.0.0 - what is replacement of bootstrap-responsive.css?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18479389/bootstrap-3-0-0-what-is-replacement-of-bootstrap-responsive-css/18479439#18479439):

My answer is just quote of the Bootstrap documentation. This question has already 16 votes, my answer has 38 :)
I don't see big different with this question, of course without counting my mistake :)

Next time I will read my question twice before publishing on:
