##JavaScipt and frameworks
Not so long time ago we have JavaScript and new nice libraries (they are usually called frameworks) like: jQuery, MooTools, YUI.
Moreover not so long time ago everybody was writing their own AJAX library.
But this changed and now we have a lot of new, shiny frameworks.
ComicStip has a [beautiful strip](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2015/09/16/how-to-choose-the-right-javascript-framework/) about it:

##Frameworks
Last few years gives a so many frameworks, which lives fast and died young. Even big "players" like Angular had problems like:
- Angular 2 won't be compatible with Angular 1
- in the begging they said: we won't give you way to upgrade
- then after community @#$@#$, they change their mind

In my work I am having problems with backbone.js, because we used it in a way which disabled easy upgrade. Of course we can make a big effort and write a big part only to enable upgrade. The question is: what for?

React.js now is in a crazy boarding state. And in 2015 everybody *must* use it.

##Next one - Aurelia?
Aurelia looks like a shiny cool new framework. It is not even in public beta, but have a great community. I check it and it really looks simple and easy to adopt - which is great. But there is one small problem - the author. [Rob Eisenberg](https://github.com/EisenbergEffect)  is a really well know JS developer. With a lot of UX/UI experience. Just look on [Aurelia framework commits](https://github.com/aurelia/framework/graphs/contributors):

So where is the problem? There is ~40 contributors to this project, but most of them changed few lines. Which means that in this project a "new" design pattern is used: Single Person Responsibility. Similar to Single Principle Responsibility, but with noticeable difference.

##The question
After all you can ask yourself one important question about your next JavaScript framework: **will it blend?**
