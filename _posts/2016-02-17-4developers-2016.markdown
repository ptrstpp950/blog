One of the biggest IT festival in Poland [4developers](http://2016.4developers.org.pl/en/) will be this year 11th April.
Last year 4developers was superb. There were a lot of different paths like: .NET, Java, PHP, UX, Front-end, Application architecture and more.
Even I have a presentation with Marcin Przekop about DevOps in mBank. It is available on YouTube (polish only):

This year is really near, but still you can send your __CFP till 22th February__.

## 2016 dotNet path 
Moreover dotNET path for sure there will have 2 great sessions:
