*Sometime ago a group of very special people did a unique application*. Above sentence can describe almost any IT project, but I am sure You will agree that the [New mBank](http://www.mbank.pl) in 100% meets above definition, including that:

1. It was completely renew of access channel to one of biggest internet bank in Poland
2. It was build by multiple teams (10+) in different cites working in parallel
3. It has unified architecture
4. It integrates with living IT infrastructure
5. Much much more

And it was done in **.NET** which is quite unique project on that scale done on the top of Microsoft technologies stack.

So if you will be on **12.11.2014 in Białystok** or somewhere near you are welcome to listen about how we did it.

The details:

* When: **2014-11-12 18:00:00**

If you decide to come, You will have unique chance to hear about:

1. How to structure and manage 1.000.000 lines of JavaScript

3. Efficiently sharing artifacts between 100+ developers
4. Making ASP.NET MVC application *really* modular
