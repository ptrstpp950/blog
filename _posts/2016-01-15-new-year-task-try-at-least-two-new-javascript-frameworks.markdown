Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)):
>Blue Monday is a name given to a day in January (typically the third Monday of the month) reported to be the most depressing day of the year. The concept was first publicised as part of a 2005 press release from holiday company Sky Travel which claimed to have calculated the date using an equation. [...]

In 2016 is predicted quite late, on 25th of January. So still there is a time to fulfill my New Year's resolution: try more new JavaScript front-end frameworks. Especially that there is a lot of new and re-new stuff on the market. Just look on below list:

##ReactJS
React is almost *passe* now as 2015 pass away. But still if you does not try it you should as soon as possible. Especially that guys from Arkency created a set with practical examples  on github. Just reserve an evening and do it even today from [reactjs koans repo](https://github.com/arkency/reactjs_koans). In my opinion it is the best resource to start with ReactJS

##Angular2
I am not an angular fan. But I know some of them. In my opinion Angular starts to be religion like Windows or Linux. You believe in it or not :)
Moreover articles like [Angular 2 versus React: There Will Be Blood](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51) doesn't make me feel better.
There is a [5 minutes quick start tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html) on official Angular page. Also http://learnangular2.com/ page looks quite interesting.

##Ember 2.0
They have the funniest `2.0` version release reason:
>Ember 2.0 only removes features that were deprecated as of Ember 1.13, so apps that run on Ember 1.13 without any deprecation warnings should run without issues on Ember 2.0.

Anyway Ember is not so popular but do not cross it out. The tutorial on official page shows basic. Just visit https://guides.emberjs.com/. For more guides check comments bellow.

##Aurelia.io
My personal favorite. I really love this framework. I only regret that I did not make any "production" site using it. But after doing tutorial form http://aurelia.io/docs.html I just fell in love with it. I have some objections which are described in [Most important question on your next JavaScript framework](/most-important-question-on-your-next-javascript-framework/), but I love it anyway.

##Why should I try?
Last week on twitter I saw bellow tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I think I&#39;ll give this new front-end framework a try.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/DBfiaFy77R">pic.twitter.com/DBfiaFy77R</a></p>&mdash; Heydon (@heydonworks) <a href="https://twitter.com/heydonworks/status/686115542407753728">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

It make me think that I had such situation a few times in my life. But JavaScript is changing fast and me/you/them/everybody should have know how "the gun" is working before trying to use it.
