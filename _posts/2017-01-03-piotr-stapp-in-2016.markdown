I have been busy in 2016. I did a lot for a community, my job and myself also. 
Moreover, I didn't realize what I achieved until today.

## Speaking
Last year I was speaking on:

- 1 grand finale of [Daj się poznać](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/gala/)
- 5 user groups including [SysOps/DevOps Polska](https://www.meetup.com/SysOpsPolska), [Dev@ZG](https://www.meetup.com/DEV-ZG), [Dev@LDZ](https://www.meetup.com/dev-LDZ) and [Warsaw Web Performance Group](https://www.meetup.com/Warsaw-Web-Performance-Group)
- 6 conferences including [Get.NET](http://konferencjaget.net), [IT w bankowości](http://gigacon.org/event/bankowosc_warszawa_2016/), [IT career summit](http://itcareersummit.pl/2016/?page_id=811), [BBQ4IT](http://bbq4.it/), [High Load Strategy LT](http://www.highloadstrategy.lt/) and [DotNetConfPL](http://dotnetconf.pl)

That is in average one talk per month. Awesome!

## Writing

- 32 posts in 52 weeks on my blog. More stats: [TOP in 2016 - some stats](https://stapp.space/top-in-2016-some-stats/). I should write more often.
- MVB award and 4 articles on DZone. For more check [my DZone profile](https://dzone.com/users/2733004/ptrstpp950.html)
- ~850 tweets on Twitter with ~200K impressions
- and [new Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/piotr.stapp) :)

## StackOverflow
Amazing stats. I'm shocked. My post reached ~1.2m people. Can you imagine 1.2 million people?

The rest is also impressive. I'm in:

- top 3% overall
- top 5% in asp.net, asp.net-mvc, C#, jquery and twitter-bootstrap tags
- top 10% in .net, asp.net-mvc4, javascript and powershell tags

## DevWarsztaty
With Jakub Gutkowski and Paweł Łukasik we organized 10 meetings last year. 10 amazing, hands-on, all-day workshops in Warsaw and Wrocław.

## French
I'm learning French on [DuoLingo](http://duolingo.com). I decide to learn French to be more romantic. For example I can say:
>La chaussette rouge

If you don't know what it is, just [google this](https://www.google.pl/search?q=la+chaussette+rouge)
I had 450+ days streak, but in the 29th of December, I forgot to do my lesson. Moreover, I forgot to buy a "code freeze". Gosh.
So here I go again. Wish me luck. 

## My job
Last year I learned that my job is top secret banking stuff 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. 
Next year will bring something new and more exciting.

## Management
Being the manager of 9 people team is exhausting. Moreover when you want to code from time to time. But I did it with a few successes. I'm really proud of myself. But to be fair, I still think that I'm better in coding than management. Or to be more precise I much more like development.

## Code
Last year I created some code in C#, JavaScript, TypeScript (new stuff), CSS+LESS (fight versus code), PowerShell, Java (stream in Java 8 are pure fun), bash and even in PHP on [devwarsztaty](http://devwarsztaty.pl). That is an awesome list. 
And still, I'm web guy with DevOps skills. Funny mix :) 

## Fun
In the last day of 2016, I learned how to ice skating backward. Can you believe it?

## Awesome
Last year was busy for me. I have worked a lot for a community, my job and myself. Moreover, I didn't realize what I did until today.
I'm really proud of myself. I still cannot believe that I did so many things. It is awesome!
