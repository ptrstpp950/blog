###Changes
In last month my work little change. For the developer I was moved up to team leader - I am not calling myself manager yet :)
But this has drastic change in my work hours. Basically I work maximum till 5 PM. Sometimes from 7:30 AM, but in 99% situations I was out of office at 5:00PM.
This allows me to study something at home, write blog post, play with my children, etc.

But this changed and I started to have situations like: "F##K F##K it is after 6PM. ARGH!!!!!" and run out of office. This one hour is really important for my life, so I decided to change this drastically.

###The Alarm Clock
I just setup my mobile phone to alarm me at 17 PM. I will give myself 5 minutes to shut down my PC and go home. I hope I will return to my previous habits, because to work hard you have to rest hard. __No pain no gain doesn't work here.__

Cross your fingers for me please :)
