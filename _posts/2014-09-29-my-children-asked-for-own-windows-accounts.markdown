## Today is end of the universe
I cannot believe, but I have following following conversation with my son (age almost 6):

- I will never hack in to Your account Daddy. - *said D.*
- Why You want to do this? - *me*
- Because I don't have my own one - *D.*
- So You want one? - *me*
- YEEEEESSSSS!!!!!!!! - *D.*
- Me to, me to. - *added M.- twin sister of D.*
[...]
- Why I don't have an account? I have to use tablet and phone - *my wife*
- Ok You will have one - *me*

So now my PC have 4 accounts instead of one:
1. Mine
2. D.
3. M.
4. My wife

It was mine old laptop with one small account, now it is a family laptop :)

Anyway I setup Microsoft Family Safety - I am really interested how it will work.
