I've returned to Windows after a year on the Mac. I built up pwsh and added a lot of tools, but I still need some Linux/MacOS ones, such as `envsubst`. Of course, WSL2 comes to the rescue, but you'll have to checkout the repo twice for Linux and Visual Studio. It is ridiculous.
I set up oh-my-posh with powerline on WSL2, which is a fantastic combination. However, there is a "but": git status is quite slow. What is the reason for this? Just read [4197](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4197)

How can this be resolved? Simply replace the git command with the git function, as shown below:
```
function git() {
  if [[ $(pwd -P) = /mnt/* ]]; then
    git.exe "$@"
  else
    command git "$@"
  fi
}
```
And that's all ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š
