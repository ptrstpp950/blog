## How to get secrets from GitHub Actions
Working with secrets can be hard. Especially when you forget their values, and you would like to retrieve them. In my case I didn't store Azure service principal for test environment anywhere.  Moreover I wanted to move them from project level into organization level. Unfortunately reading them from GitHub is not possible, but the actions have them.  What have left? Of course some hacking.

Of course running:
```
steps:
  - run: |
      echo '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}'
```
won't work because GitHub is smart enough to replace any secret with `***`

What alternatives we have? I see three:

### Uploading somewhere
We can upload it to external endpoint - too complicated, but for sure it will work. I think about it but I didn't try, because other methods worked ðŸ˜…

### Use base64
That's the most typical trick. Instead of echo a secret, we can try to echo bas64 of this secret. 
The job is quite obvious but let's write it down:
```
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}' | base64
```
To be fair the result was quite strange. I received partially good file, but with omitted `clientSecret`, which I was looking for. So the output was:
```

```
Which decoded to:
```

  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```
Good work GitHub! Anyway let's try something else.


### Use artifacts
Last try! We can write it to the file and upload it as an artifact. It shocked me, but it works like a charm
```
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}' > file.txt
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: file.txt
          path: file.txt
```
The uploaded file had all the data.
Only remember to delete the workflow run after test ðŸ˜€

That's all folks
