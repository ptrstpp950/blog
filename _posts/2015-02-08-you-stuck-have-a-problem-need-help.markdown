Almost every day we have an unsolved problem. So of them: 
- Where is my ball? Daddy help!!!
- Dude were is my ride?
- Who have seen my keys?
- Why my project does not work?

For first three, usually we have to deal with it alone or ask [our wives](https://www.google.pl/search?q=i+don%27t+need+google+my+wife+knows+everything&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=775&tbm=isch&imgil=pMqeHZ52uMgdaM%253A%253BXXki2MFz8ARP1M%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.tshirtrocket.com%25252Findex.php%25253Fmain_page%2525253Dproduct_info%25252526products_id%2525253D4262&source=iu&pf=m&fir=pMqeHZ52uMgdaM%253A%252CXXki2MFz8ARP1M%252C_&usg=__hYAvkjbBmORdjKw2yJC1jQpG0so%3D&dpr=1&ved=0CCsQyjc&ei=ETfXVKOoG-P8ygPHq4D4Bw#imgdii=_&imgrc=nDjVWjksf6UO6M%253A%3BmTJlnkbmG82ghM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fmedia.tsharks.in%252Fcatalog%252Fproduct%252Fcache%252F1%252Fimage%252F1000x1000%252F9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95%252Fg%252Fo%252Fgoogle-white-men-tshirt.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.tsharks.in%252Findex.php%252Ftshirts%252Flol-tees%252Fi-don-t-need-google-my-wife-knows-everything-white-tshirt.html%3B1000%3B1000).

I don't know why, but for last problem the "wife option" does not work.

###Simple problem, simple solution
Our first choice is Google (or Bing) and we are redirect to StackOverflow/forum/blog. 30 seconds and we are happy.
If problem is a little more complicated (or we didn't search enough) we can ask question. My case: Last week I need to calculate stats for **all** threads, which I was executing. SO was the perfect solution and I received a [full generic code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28366387/get-statistic-of-executed-tasks-in-c-sharp)


###Complex stuff
Above stack works perfectly when we have a problem in code. But what about problem with external solution - it can be "black box", open-source, something mixed - especially when it is a performance solution.
I suggest to do following:

- find official forum (sometimes it is SO) - in my opinion authors don't like unanswered question, so someone will take care
- find official mailing group - I hate this kind of forum, but it works same as above
- use social media
- if someone answer on above, especially when he is evangelist or author "attack" him personally :)
- ask your friends - maybe someone knows a specialist 

Using all above options remember about most important option:
