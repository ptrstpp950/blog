For today quote by Winston S. Churchill 
>A good speech should be like a woman's skirt; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest.

So go ahead and do your work. There is a lot of places when you can present yourself. I know that you are shy and do nothing interesting, just like me. But for 99% of people what you are doing is much more interesting that what they do. Believe me, just look around :)
