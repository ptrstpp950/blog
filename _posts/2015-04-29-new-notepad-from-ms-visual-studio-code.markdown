First time form original Notepad Microsoft created a lightweight tool for coders:
#####Visual Studio Code (Preview)

There is a lot of amazing stuff what has changed:

1. It is available on **Windows, Mac and Linux**
2. It has Git
3. It support **ASP.NET 5 and Node.js**
4. It has **debugger** build-in
5. It is lightweight (~50MB to download)
6. **It opens fast**

No go and download it as it is hot: https://code.visualstudio.com/

p.s. Why didn't MS have this strategy ten years ago? :(
