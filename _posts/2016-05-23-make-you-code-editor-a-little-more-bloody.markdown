Your Integrated Development Environment(IDE) is Your main tool. Anything that can make it better is worth of trying :)
Nowadays we are using usually more than one IDE. For example Visual Studio for backend and Sublime for the frontend. Or maybe You prefer IntelliJ/WebStorm/PyCharm/PhpStorm with Vim?
Also, Xcode with TextMate and Visual Studio Code is an interesting combo.

##Black or white?
A long time ago Michael Jackson sing:

<div style=" width:100%;float:left;text-align:center;">
<iframe style="margin: 0 auto; width: 480px;height: 266px;" src="//giphy.com/embed/mrPsq5HMHImgU" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

But if you ask any developer, it really matters if his editor is black or white :)

For me, the biggest problem was with colors during switching between different editors.
The second problem is key scheme, but this is a different story :)
I always set black/dark theme but differences irritate me.

#Blood is good
Sometime ago at least I found solution: [__Dracula theme__](http://zenorocha.github.io/dracula-theme/) for all editors. If you favourite is missing you can add it, because it is open-source. Sweet is it? 
Just check it out:

Now all we can have a _bloody_ editor. Have fun!
