##Who am I?
I call myself in random order: developer, engineer, craftsmen, speaker & biker. 
I am a user of all useful technologies. 
I believe in people, not in papers. 
I pretend to be a DevOps & automation adept. 
I am in love with web technologies. I speak here for myself only.

##About this blog
I speak here for myself only. But if you know me in person, you can find things related to my current job or hobbies.

I try to share my experience, thoughts, and ideas. There are a lot of topics I am interested in - mostly DevOps, web technologies and Microsoft stuff.
