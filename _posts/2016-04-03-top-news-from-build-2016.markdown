Build 2016 just ended. I wasn't lucky to watch it live. Fortunately live streaming, twitter, and news were available.
There were a lot of sessions and news. I decided to present my favorites.

##Bash on Windows
This was the first day top news. Running `apt-get` sounds great, especially if you did some stuff on Linux. I don't know it yet, but I hope so that alongside with Docker we can run every Docker image native on Windows. 
I hope it won't be just cool stuff, but a real useful tool. Unfortunately, we have to wait until Windows 10 Update will be public. Up to then we can only read about it on [Scott Hanselman blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopersCanRunBashShellAndUsermodeUbuntuLinuxBinariesOnWindows10.aspx)

##Xamarin - free and Open Source
In my opinion, this looks like a game changer. Until now I didn't have a chance to use Xamarin because my pet project took longer that 30 days (demo time).
Now I will have a chance to create a full mobile app using even Xamarin.Forms

##Holo lens
Holo Lens developer edition is ready to buy. But only for devs in USA and Canada. I'm from Europe, so I will have to wait - gosh :(

##Xbox One
Maybe I should buy Xbox One. Paying 19$ (plus console) you can convert it to Dev Console and test your Windows Apps.
It will be a great reason to convince my wife to buy Xbox One. Please keep your fingers crossed for me and my kids

##Chat bots
Microsoft announced tools for creating powerful chat bots. Sound funny and I hope that I will have a chance to use it on real product. For example it will be great as a helper to our product without buying an expensive external tool-set. Check it out on [github](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder) and https://dev.botframework.com/

#Next Visual Studio "15"
Visual Studio "15" is in preview version. It is avaliable on https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs15-preview-vs.aspx. The coolest thing is that it is small - less than 1GB.
Watch more on youtube: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvJoYlaKgEA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

##Sumary
I will have a few working weekends in near future to explore new stuff and I hope Windows 10 update will be available soon.

Did you notice something that I missed? Just let me know in comments.
